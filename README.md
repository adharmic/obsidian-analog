This plug-in is a simple analog clock that can be pinned to your workspace.

It only has the base features of a clock face and a date display, but I hope to add more features soon (like timers, reminders, etc.)

I also have plans of making the clock stylable with different options for the hour numbers and perhaps the positioning.

Many thanks to Huy Bui for their Medium article here: https://medium.com/@williamhuybui/creating-an-analog-clock-with-html-css-and-javascript-32a254da8a9e 

To Use:
- The plugin adds a ribbon icon that will open a leaf in the right workspace. That leaf will display a simple analog clock with the current time.
